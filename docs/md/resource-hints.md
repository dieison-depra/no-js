# Resource Hints

No.JS automatically injects `<link>` resource hints into `<head>` to help
browsers start network requests before they are needed. This reduces Time to
First Byte (TTFB) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) with no configuration.

## What is injected automatically

### `preload` — static `get=` URLs

When a `get=` directive has a static URL (no `{interpolation}`), a
`<link rel="preload" as="fetch">` is injected at directive init time:

```html
<!-- This get= URL is static → preload is injected automatically -->
<div get="/api/products" as="products">...</div>

<!-- Dynamic URL → no preload (value not known until state resolves) -->
<div get="/api/products/{id}" as="product">...</div>
```

Injected hint:
```html
<link rel="preload" href="/api/products" as="fetch" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### `preconnect` — cross-origin endpoints

When the `get=` URL's origin differs from `location.origin`, a
`<link rel="preconnect">` is also injected for that origin:

```html
<div get="https://api.mystore.com/products" as="products">...</div>
```

Injected hints:
```html
<link rel="preload"    href="https://api.mystore.com/products" as="fetch" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://api.mystore.com" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### `prefetch` — remote route templates

When the router initialises, a `<link rel="prefetch" as="fetch">` is injected
for every `<template route src="...">`:

```html
<template route="/about"   src="./pages/about.tpl"></template>
<template route="/contact" src="./pages/contact.tpl"></template>
```

Injected hints:
```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="./pages/about.tpl"   as="fetch" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link rel="prefetch" href="./pages/contact.tpl" as="fetch" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

All hints are **deduplicated** — if the same URL already has a hint in `<head>`
(e.g. injected at build time), no duplicate is added.

## Build-time injection (recommended for LCP)

Runtime hints fire after JavaScript executes — too late to help the very first
page load. For maximum impact on LCP, inject the same hints into the initial
HTML at build time using the provided post-build script:

```sh
node scripts/inject-resource-hints.js
# or with a custom glob:
node scripts/inject-resource-hints.js "dist/**/*.html"
```

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "your-bundler && node scripts/inject-resource-hints.js"
  }
}
```

The script scans every `.html` file in `dist/`, parses it with jsdom (already a
devDependency for tests), and injects the same three hint types listed above.
Existing hints are never duplicated.

### CI/CD integration

Run the script as a post-build step in your pipeline. The `&&` ensures it only
runs when the bundler succeeds:

```sh
# npm scripts (package.json)
"build": "your-bundler && node scripts/inject-resource-hints.js"

# GitHub Actions
- name: Build
  run: npm run build

# GitLab CI
build:
  script:
    - npm run build
```

For monorepos or custom output directories, pass a glob explicitly:

```sh
node scripts/inject-resource-hints.js "public/**/*.html"
```

### Hints and component lifecycle

Resource hints injected by the build-time script (or at runtime) are **not
removed** if the route or component that triggered them is later destroyed.
This is intentional — hints are advisory signals to the browser, not DOM state
tied to a component. Leaving them in `<head>` is harmless: the browser ignores
hints for resources it has already fetched or that are no longer needed.

If you dynamically swap large portions of the route config and want to prevent
stale hints from accumulating, remove the relevant `<link>` elements manually
via JavaScript after navigation.

## `crossorigin` and credentialed APIs

All hints use `crossorigin="anonymous"`. This is correct for:

- Same-origin APIs
- Public cross-origin APIs that do not require credentials

If a cross-origin API requires **credentials** (cookies or an `Authorization`
header), the `preload` hint must use `crossorigin="use-credentials"` or the
browser will discard the prefetched response (CORS mismatch). In that case,
write the hint manually in `<head>` rather than relying on automatic injection:

```html
<head>
  <!-- Manual hint for a credentialed cross-origin API -->
  <link rel="preload" href="https://api.mystore.com/me"
        as="fetch" crossorigin="use-credentials">
</head>
```

## Summary

| Hint | Trigger | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| `preload` | Static `get=` URL | Starts the API request before JS renders the component |
| `preconnect` | Cross-origin `get=` URL | Eliminates DNS + TLS round-trip for external APIs |
| `prefetch` | `<template route src>` | Loads route templates in the background after first paint |
